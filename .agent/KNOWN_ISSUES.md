# IsotopeAI Android — Known Issues

---

## ISSUE-001 — Destructive email availability check
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** FIXED IN CODE + UNIT TESTED (2026-06-29)

`android-bridge.js` previously handled `/__auth/check` by calling Supabase `/auth/v1/signup` with a generated dummy password. That is not a safe availability check and could create users, send confirmation mail, and consume auth rate limits.

**Current fix:** `/__auth/check` returns a neutral response and performs zero signup requests.

**Evidence:** `npm test` includes `/__auth/check is neutral and performs no signup request`.

## ISSUE-002 — Bootstrap contract mismatch
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** FIXED IN CODE + UNIT TESTED (2026-06-29)

Android bootstrap previously returned `onboarding_completed` without the canonical `onboarding` object, and returned the full `user_profiles` row as `profile` instead of exposing raw `profile_data`. `restore-and-launch.js` reads `snapshot.onboarding.completed`, `profile_data`, `cloud_snapshot`, `study_sessions_log`, and `stats_summary`, so boot routing could treat completed users as not onboarded.

**Current fix:** `/__auth/bootstrap` now returns the server-compatible shape, including `onboarding`, `onboarding_completed`, `profile`, `profile_data`, `profile_updated_at`, `settings`, `tours`, `stats_summary`, `daily_user_stats`, `study_sessions_log`, `cloud_snapshot`, `best_backup`, `backup_candidates`, `restore_recommended`, `backup_warning`, and `fetched_at`.

**Evidence:** `npm test` covers canonical completed onboarding, legacy `onboarding_completed`, seeded incomplete onboarding, legacy migration, nested `profile_data`, and network failure.

## ISSUE-003 — Auth navigation race after login
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** FIXED IN PATCH SCRIPT + UNIT TESTED (2026-06-29)

The compiled Auth bundle navigated to `/dashboard` whenever `signIn().success` was true. Since `auth-bridge.js` is loaded after `android-bridge.js` and becomes the active login implementation, login could race against restore/bootstrap routing and skip onboarding.

**Current fix:** `scripts/apply-android-patches.js` patches the Auth bundle login handler to call `window.__isoLogin`, wait for bootstrap, and route exactly once based on `bootstrap.onboarding.completed`.

**Evidence:** `npm test` includes `apply-android-patches makes Auth login route exactly once from bootstrap`.

## ISSUE-004 — Minified bundle patch compatibility
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** PARTIALLY VERIFIED

Required patch targets now fail the build if absent or ambiguous. The current source commit was tested locally with `npm run prepare-www`, `npm run apply-patches`, `npx cap sync android`, and a second `npm run apply-patches`.

**Remaining risk:** This is still a high-risk compatibility layer. More patch-contract coverage is needed for asset existence, hash reporting, JavaScript parsing of patched chunks, and index.html reference validation.

## ISSUE-005 — GitHub Actions access to isotope-code
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** UNKNOWN UNTIL PUSHED

The workflow checks out `Suydev/isotope-code` at pinned commit `fd39fad1384333ad774f19f35b754659a34dae60`. If that repository is private and the default GitHub token lacks access, the build will fail during checkout.

**Fix options if it fails:**
- Make `Suydev/isotope-code` accessible to the workflow.
- Add a cross-repo read token as a GitHub secret and configure checkout to use it.

## ISSUE-006 — Native notifications are not implemented
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** OPEN

The Web Notification polyfill is not sufficient for process-death reliability. A real Android notification implementation must schedule from an absolute timer completion timestamp, survive WebView process death where Android permits, restore after restart/reboot, and route notification taps to `/focus`.

---

## ISSUE-007 — Timer process-death behavior is unverified
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** OPEN

The timer still needs packaged APK tests for backgrounding, rotation, force-stop/relaunch, process recreation, clock changes, pause/resume, exactly-once completion, no duplicate Supabase session, and no duplicate notification.

---

## ISSUE-008 — Backup safety requires Android evidence
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** OPEN

`BLOCKED_EMPTY_OVERWRITE` must be preserved and verified in the packaged APK. Empty fresh install must never overwrite richer cloud data.

---

## ISSUE-009 — WAV sound files are large
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** OPEN

`www/sounds/` currently contributes about 41.8 MB after packaging: rain, wind, and crickets WAV files. Convert to OGG/AAC in a later size-reduction task only after core repair is stable.

---

## ISSUE-010 — GitHub CLI unavailable locally
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** OPEN

`gh` is not installed in this environment. Baseline artifact download, `gh run list`, workflow log inspection, and PR creation cannot be done through the GitHub CLI here.
